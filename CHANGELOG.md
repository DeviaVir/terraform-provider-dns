## 3.0.0 (Unreleased)

NEW FEATURES:

* **New Data Source:** `dns_mx_record_set` [GH-71]
* **New Resource:** `dns_mx_record_set` [GH-71]
* **New Resource:** `dns_txt_record_set` [GH-72]
* All resources can now be imported [GH-37]
* Allow the creation of apex records [GH-69]
* Retry DNS queries on timeout [GH-68]

IMPROVEMENTS:

* dependencies: switching to Go 1.11 [GH-73]
* The provider is now compatible with Terraform v0.12, while retaining compatibility with prior versions.

## 2.0.0 (May 25, 2018)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* Prior versions of the provider would sign requests when sending updates to a DNS server but would not sign the requests to read those values back on subsequent refreshes. For consistency, now _read_ requests are also signed for managed resources in this provider. This does not apply to the data sources, which continue to just send normal unsigned DNS requests as before.

NEW FEATURES:

* Use signed requests when refreshing managed resources ([#35](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-dns/issues/35))
* data/dns_ptr_record_set: Implement data source for PTR record. ([#32](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-dns/issues/32))

BUGS FIXED:

* Normalize IP addresses before comparing them, so non-canonical forms don't cause errant diffs ([#13](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-dns/issues/13))
* Validates zone names are fully qualified and that record names are not as these mistakes seems to be a common source of misconfiguration ([#36](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-dns/issues/36))
* Properly handle IPv6 IP addresses as the update host. Previously this would create an invalid connection address due to not properly constructing the address format. ([#22](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-dns/issues/22))
* When refreshing DNS record resources, `NXDOMAIN` errors are now properly marked as deletions in state rather than returning an error, thus allowing Terraform to plan to re-create the missing records. ([#33](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-dns/issues/33))
* Now checks the type of record returned to prevent unexpected values causing a panic ([#39](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-dns/issues/39))

## 1.0.0 (September 15, 2017)

* No changes from 0.1.1; just adjusting to [the new version numbering scheme](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-terraform-provider-versioning/).

## 0.1.1 (August 28, 2017)

NEW FEATURES:

* **`dns_aaaa_record_set` data source** for fetching IPv6 address records ([#9](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-dns/issues/9))
* **`dns_ns_record_set` data source** for fetching nameserver records ([#10](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-dns/issues/10))
* **`dns_ns_record_set` resource** for creating new nameserver records via the DNS update protocol ([#10](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-dns/issues/10))

## 0.1.0 (June 20, 2017)

NOTES:

* Same functionality as that of Terraform 0.9.8. Repacked as part of [Provider Splitout](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/upcoming-provider-changes-in-terraform-0-10/)
